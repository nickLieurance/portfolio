    <meta name="description" content="I worked with SurveyMonkey to design Build with AI, a feature that helps anyone create a high-quality survey from a simple prompt. Over six months, I shaped the AI prompt structure, feature name, terminology, and UI copy to make the experience intuitive for users of all skill levels. By analyzing competitors, introducing guided prompt patterns, refining the UX with cross-functional partners, and validating the flow through usability testing, I helped launch a feature that quickly became a top performer for new users. In its first year, it generated more than 275,000 surveys and earned strong customer feedback for making survey creation faster, easier, and more accessible.">

        <p>Build with AI is for all survey authors, novices and experts alike. Even people on free plans can use it, although they need to upgrade if they want to include premium question types in their surveys.

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>It's hard to write a good survey. You need strong writing skills. You have to know what questions to ask
                and
                in what order. Even if you can do all that, it takes a long time to write a survey. How could we
                use AI to make the process easier for users of all levels?</p>

            <h2>My solution</h2>
            <p>I analyzed competitors to identify content needs and opportunities. What I found was that it's not easy to write a good prompt. Most competitors solved this problem by offering sample prompts. The designer and I spoke about the challenge and agreed on a similar solution. When the designer showed me an initial concept based on our discussion, I decided to add a bit of step-by-step guidance. Then we worked together to refine the design and gather feedback from stakeholders. When we had our final design, I ran a usability study to make sure it felt intuitive to users. To choose the feature name, I ran a workshop where cross-functional stakeholders aligned on criteria, brainstormed, and shortlisted three names. Then I surveyed 200 people to determine the winning name.</p>

The AI feature exceeded my expectations, allowing me to effortlessly craft a comprehensive and professional survey for our sister non-profit groups. In just three attempts, I had a survey ready for board approval. Thank you, SurveyMonkey, for making survey creation not only simple and intuitive but also enjoyable!"</blockquote>
