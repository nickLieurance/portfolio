                <li><b>Product:</b> VuLink</li>
                <li><b>Platform:</b> Hardware, mobile app, and web app</li>
                <li><b>Timeline:</b> ~12 months</li>
                <li><b>My contributions:</b> User documentation, terminology, UI copy for mobile and web</li>
                <li><b>Description:</b> VuLink is a telemetry device used in water monitoring. It connects to a data logger, which records information about temperature, pH, and other things. VuLink uploads that data to the cloud. This project entailed development of the device, a mobile app, and a web app.</li>

        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>VuLink is for people and organizations involved in monitoring water resources. Examples include scientists at the USGS, compliance personnel at mining operations, and others.</p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Environmental scientists often install telemetry systems in remote areas where access is difficult and costly. Incorrect setup could necessitate days of driving, or even a helicopter ride, to fix. How would we give users the confidence to deploy a complex telemetry system, in the field, with minimal support?</p>

        <h2>My solution</h2>
        <p>My work began with the project kickoff. I participated in daily standups and weekly team syncs to keep documentation and content work aligned with the rest of the project. When engineers discovered that incorrect battery installation could cause a fire, the UX designer and I came up with a solution: a sticker in the instrument's battery compartment and a warning in the quickstart guide. After launch, our sales and support teams shared customer feedback with me. I addressed it with new online FAQs. </p>

        <p>As the UX and software teams fleshed out parts of the experience, I translated internal jargon into plain language.</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>Engineers used the term "end of session" to refer to the moment when the software disconnects from VuLink. </li>
                <li>Early designs for the app had a "reporting" section. But Support said that word already had a specific meaning to users.</li>
                <li>Internally, people called anything connected to VuLink a "downstream" instrument. In water, an instrument can literally be downstream.</li>
             </ul>

        <p>I made a four-page quickstart guide (two pieces of paper) to make installation almost foolproof. I included photos with step-by-step instructions. Plain language makes the content easy to understand. Because some users have more advanced needs and want specs, I also made a full PDF manual.</p>
