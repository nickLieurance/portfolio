I’ve built the content systems behind data-centric SaaS tools—including style guides, knowledge bases, and scalable content repositories—and contributed to multiple #1 features across three companies. My work has driven revenue growth, strengthened cross-functional collaboration, and earned recognition from customers and internal teams alike. I’m currently focused on creating processes and frameworks that help product teams move faster and deliver consistent, user-centered experiences. Outside of work, I study Spanish and enjoy connecting with people through language.">

<div class="col-md-6">I’m a design thinker who helps people make sense of complex concepts. Over the past 10 years, I’ve built the content repositories, style guides, knowledge bases, and other systems behind many intuitive products. During that time, I drove two years of revenue growth at Popular Woodworking, created documentation called "the best of any manufacturer we work with" at In-Situ, and contributed to multiple #1 features across three companies. Right now, I’m focused on building systems that improve XFN collaboration and help teams scale. I’ve worked on data-centric SaaS products for 10 years. On a person note, I study Spanish and can converse about nearly any topic. </div>
